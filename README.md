"# LeagueProbability
 # Trying to make code that can efficiently come up with a ""perfect"" round robin league. 
 # By definition in a round robin league each team faces each other team once. 
 # To make the ""perfect"" league I am taking into consideration that each team must have equal if not close to equal amount of home
 # and away games. Along with that, given distances between the teams it will then take into consideration travel distance to choose
 # the league with the most fair amount of travel distance for each team by use of the lowest standard deviation of travel distances. "
